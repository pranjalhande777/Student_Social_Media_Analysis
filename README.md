# Student Social Media & Mental Health Analysis

This project explores how students use social media and how it affects their sleep and overall well-being. The goal is to understand usage patterns, identify risk groups, and recommend ways to promote healthier digital habits.

* Project Overview

Students today spend a large part of their day on social media.
This project analyzes:

1. Daily screen time

2. Sleep hours and energy levels

3. Most-used social media platforms

4. Effects of relationship status on sleep and mental health

5. Demographic profiles (age, gender, country, academic level)

Our findings highlight a strong relationship between high social media use and low sleep duration, which can directly impact mental health.
